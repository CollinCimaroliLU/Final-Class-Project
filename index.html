            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm 26 years old and an aspiring software engineer who's currently enrolled in college at Lewis University.  I had some coding knowledge before coming back to school but I need to 
                improve that knowledge before I can get a job in software.  So far, I've worked in leadership for logistics and chemical manufacturing companies.  I have a passion for bringing 
                teams closer together and learning how to work to everyone's strong suits.  I plan on bringing that passion into the software world.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of work, I love to spend time with friends and family.  My family and I share an affinity for the outdoors, so anything happening outside and in nature interests me.  I also 
                love to cook and explore local cuisine.  If you have any food suggestions, please send them my way!
